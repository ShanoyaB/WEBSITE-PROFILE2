            <p>Hi, I'm Shanoya Bailey. I'm a Computer Science major at the <a href="https://www.utech.edu.jm/" target="_blank" style="color:bisque;">University of Technology</a> (Utech). I enjoy reading e-books, playing The Sims 4<sup>&#174;</sup>, and binge-watching Korean dramas. People often describe me as loving, compassionate, and funny. I think my goofiness, happiness, and affection really show who I am. <br><br>With these emotions, I can communicate and resonate with my peers. However, my hobbies sometimes distract me from my academic life, leading me to procrastinate. But, it is who I am.</p>

        <div id="hc3">
            <p>My favourite scene is from the film Zombie 4. In the opening moments, energetic pop music plays as the cast appears on screen against a beach backdrop with rolling waves. As the lyrics begin, the characters start to move in rhythm. The choreography includes synchronized steps and coordinated arm movements. The camera cuts between wide group shots and closer shots of individual characters smiling and performing. The tone feels upbeat and celebratory. The scene features various Daywalkers in vibrant red-and-white costumes; the camera shifts to show different outfits and looks. Some characters wear bright, vibrant clothing, while others have more dramatic, stylized costumes. Each change in movement is matched to the beat of the music, making the visuals feel lively and dynamic. They are performing dance sequences that align with the song's rhythm as they sing. By this point, the group choreography becomes more vigorous. The cast moves in unison across the screen, and the camera pans and zooms to emphasize movement and rhythm. There are energetic expressions, smiling faces, and a strong sense of togetherness as the music builds toward the next section of the song. This choreography establishes a lively, engaging tone that captivates viewers from the outset. Frequent camera cuts between different dancers further enhance the sense of dynamism and excitement.</p>

            <p>From the book “Twelve Pillars”, it is a narrative fictional work that emphasizes the personal development principles one should have in life. Furthermore, each chapter explores different aspects of personal development through fictional characters, presenting relatable situations that resonate with readers. The book’s main characters its centered around is Micheal; 40-year-old man and Charlies; elderly 70-year-old man. Charlies provides detailed guidance on how to achieve a meaningful life, such as choosing friendships and associations wisely, or even personal growth begins with you and your discipline to change. Hence, these tools and words of wisdom can be applied in our lives to further our personal growth as individuals</p>

            <h3 style="text-align: center;text-decoration: underline; color:rgb(249, 198, 203); font-size: 150%;">Summary</h3>
            <p>o  Chapter 4: <br>
            -	This chapter is titled “Achieve Your Goals”. Firstly, Michael arranged a meeting with Charlie at a diner where they talked about how to achieve goals. Charlie recommends that Michael write down his goals; a hundred goals to be exact. This led to further discussion on making goals and the steps needed to turn dreams into reality. Furthermore, this is a cornerstone of success where the chapter provides timeless strategies for defining your vision, staying focused, and taking action to achieve the success you desire. And for this to happen, investment of time and effort into oneself, which includes developing new skills, expanding knowledge, and cultivating positive habits. <br><br>
            
            o	Chapter 5: <br>
            -	This chapter is titled “The Proper Use of Time”. Still under the setting of the diner, Charlie’s provides another pillar of success to Micheal where they focus on the importance of proper time management. Moreover, the chapter emphasizes that time is a precious resource that should be utilized wisely to achieve personal growth and success. “……something will master and something will serve. Either you run the day or the day runs you. Either you control your time or it controls you. Take your pick…” quoted from the book that Charlie spoke towards Micheal about investing time in oneself, to develop new skills, cultivate positive habits to enhance their value in the marketplace and open doors to new possibilities. <br><br>
    
            o	Chapter 6: <br>
            -	This chapter is titled “Surround Yourself With the Best People”. Uniquely, this chapter takes place at the house of Mr. Davis, where Charlie provides again another set of wisdom to Michael on the importance of surrounding oneself with the best people. Hence the emphasis that the people you choose to be with will influence and impact your success as well as happiness. The chapter encourages readers to seek out individuals who share their values and goals, as their presence can provide support, inspiration, and motivation; “……. To attract attractive people you must be attractive. To attract powerful people you must be powerful. To attract committed people you must be committed……” quoted from Charlie towards Michael. Therefore, social circle impacts personal development and overall well-being. <br><br>

            o	Chapter 7: <br>
            -	This chapter is titled “Be a Life-Long Learner”. Additionally, this chapter continues under the same setting at Mr. Davis’s home, but Charlie imparks another pillar of the concept of becoming a life-long learner. “Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.” Quoted from Charlie towards Michael, the immaculate observations that many assume graduating from high school or college will make everything they know about life. But the principles from Mr. Davis state that while formal education provides a living, self-education will be more valuable to oneself. Successful people never stop learning, and continuous reading will bring about understanding that develops.

            <h3 style="text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; color:rgb(236, 250, 114); font-size: 150%;">Personal Application</h3>
            <p>While reading the book “Twelve Pillars”, I have realized that in some way or another, I have utilized these principles. Similarly, like the concept of organizing your goals for long-term and short-term, I have done so, through making lists and prioritizing what’s important and how to accomplish them. With the assistance of the book, conceptualizing the idea has started the process of working towards my goals. In detail, my long-term goal is to purchase my own home and a car. Hence, to achieve such goals requires developing my skills and acquiring my degree in Computer Science to earn a fortune. Then, with further determination and financial planning, purchasing my house will be a reality, turned from my words on a page. However, my faults are in the department of maintaining friendships. As a result, many friendships and associations have been strained. But with the guidance from the book, I have realized the importance of maintaining relationships, which takes time and effort; just like how it takes patience, time, and consistent effort to maintain a beautiful garden.</p>

            <a href="https://clickup.com/blog/ai-business-ideas/?" target="_blank" style="color:lightpink; text-align: center;font-size: 150%;"><h3>AI Businesses of 2025</h3></a>
            <p>
                My favourite idea from the list is number 19: “AI for travel and hospitality”. However, utilizing artificial intelligence to transform how people plan, book and experience travel and related services would help solve persistent challenges in the tourism and hospitality industry such as choosing destinations, optimizing plans, managing budgets, handling group travel logistics, and improving service automation. Furthermore, current systems are still manual, slow, or fragmented and travelers increasingly expect personalized, real-time, easy booking within a sector valued in the trillions of dollars annually. But a solution can be integrated as of recent industry trends show major travel brands investing in AI. An example is European travel generates inspirational content and customer tools to enhance their trip (Almeida, 2025).<br><br>Furthermore, I love to travel and to have a platform where seamless access to accommodation and budgeting would be the perfect solution for many travel agencies and industry. An AI-driven travel and hospitality business could offer several capabilities such as Personalized Trip Planning: AI systems tailor recommendations for travel by analyzing user preferences such as budget, interests, and travel dates, effectively managing complex group needs and conflicting preferences, offering personalized advice over generic solutions. (source)Another is Contextual and Real-time Recommendations: By giving them the ability to respond to inquiries, control check-ins and check-outs, modify plans, and supervise hotel operations like room allocations and cleaning scheduling, artificial intelligence (AI) improves chatbots and virtual assistants (Angular Minds, 2026). Additionally, this can be beneficial to increase automation, meaning fewer manual tasks for travel agents and service operators; new revenue streams, AI-powered tour guides and personalized travel services enhance the travel experience, while dynamic pricing tools optimize cost management in the tourism industry. Also, reflect on the ethical issues around the idea you chose; and lastly, higher operational efficiency, resulting in hotels and tour operators can optimize staffing, bookings and pricing.<br><br>But an ethical issue around this idea is: User Consent and Data Privacy.Ethical concern: AI travel platforms mostly depend on private information such History of locations, Preferences for travel, financial data, and Booking practices. Users may be subject to dangers like identity theft or illegal profiling if their data is gathered or shared without their express consent, violating their right to privacy.<br><u>Why it matters:</u> Travel information can provide extremely private details about an individual's routines, travel patterns, and way of life. Misuse erodes confidence and may violate data protection regulations.<br>Solution is put in place stringent data governance guidelines so that when collecting data, use express opt-in consent. Furthermore, minimize the amount of data you acquire. When feasible, anonymize and encrypt user data. Additionally, clearly and simply describe the usage of data. This preserves user confidence while guaranteeing the ethical treatment of personal data.
